# CSS Snippets
My personal CSS snippets, **crafted with patience, utility & lot's of love!**

## Use it in your own projects

You can use these in your projects with the github.io link:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ynvrshzl.github.io/css-snippets/main.css">
```


## Why did I create this?

I created these snippets becuase I use them eerywhere in my projects. I mostly work with web development, so CSS has really great layout control. Which makes content more readable & accessible to more kinds of people, which is my primary  mission in my life. Enjoy!




## Modular, non-bloated utility design

You know what I dislike about those other css libraries? They're always super bloated with lots of features & things you don't need. These were designed to be as lightweight as possible, while being modular. You can import any of the stylesheets & also use specific setups in your work.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ynvrshzl.github.io/css-snippets/themes/atom.css">
```
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ynvrshzl.github.io/css-snippets/setups/mono.min.css">
```
