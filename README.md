# CSS Snippets
My personal CSS snippets, **crafted with patience, utility & lot's of love!**


# Why did I create this?
I created these snippets becuase I use them eerywhere in my projects. I mostly work with web development, so CSS has really great layout control. Which makes content more readable & accessible to more kinds of people, which is my primary  mission in my life. Enjoy these :)

# Use it in your own projects
You can use these in your projects with a CDN provider like:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ynvrshzl/css-snippets/main.css">
